Small python scripts to manipulate the polygons
- linetopoly.py: Adds padding to a line and converts it to a polygon
- merge_poly.py: Merge polygons that have a certain percentage of overlap
- overlap_diff_poly.py: Delete all overlaps from polygons in a feature collection
- filter_poly.py: Only return polygons in a certain radius of a point
- rewind.py: Rewinds polygon so that it follows the right hand rule
- polygon_split.py: WIP. Break polygons into smaller parts while maintaining the shape
